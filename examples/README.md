# Example "Recipes" ðŸ¥—

The example recipes are located in the `examples/` directory. These are also used for testing the infrastructure using [terratest], nonetheless, they are meant to run independently and be checked directly using _vanilla_ terraform commands.

## Recipe's structure

The recipe's structure is described below:

```txt
tree examples/
examples/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ TaskFile.yml
â””â”€â”€ default
    â””â”€â”€ basic
        â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
        â”œâ”€â”€ config
        â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ fixtures.tfvars
        â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf
        â”œâ”€â”€ providers.tf
        â”œâ”€â”€ variables.tf
        â””â”€â”€ versions.tf
```

>**NOTE**: The parent directory `examples/` includes all the **recipes**, being _default_ the "by default" recipe that represents the very basics of the module that's being developed.

## Run recipes directly

Use [Taskfile] for doing so. The `Taskfile.yml` file is located in the root of the repo, and it's used for running the recipes. The [Taskfile] tasks that are related to these recipes are customizable by the following input variables:

* `MODULE`: The module's name. Default: `default` â€” it should match the module's name defined beneath the directory `examples/`. E.g.: `examples/<MODULE>/...`
* `RECIPE`: The recipe's name. Default: `basic` â€” it should match the recipe's name defined beneath the directory `examples/<MODULE>/...`. E.g.: `examples/<MODULE>/<RECIPE>/...`

```bash
task recipe-init
```

```bash
task recipe-ci
```

```bash
task recipe-plan
```
